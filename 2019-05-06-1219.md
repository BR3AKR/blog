I recreated my blog today using W3C's [super-cool template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_blog.htm). Props to those guys over there for putting something together so clean and easy to use. I just grabbed their template as it is, cracked it open in vscode and made some modifications to pull from my blog server.
<!--BREAK-->
I removed the images in their example. I like the way images look in their blog, but the truth is, this thing is going to be for technical stuff. I don't really see taking a ton of pictures of things other than conventions or something.

On the right hand side of the blog you should see a section on popular posts. Right now I'm literally just placing every post in there (they're all popular, right?!). In the future I'd like to add a like button or something on my posts and just place the most liked posts there.

I also have a section containing my picture and a super-brief about me. I intend to get my email, twitter, and github added in there for easy access. Then that section should be done.

Lower than that is the tag section. I have an awful lot of work to do there. In the metadata for all of my posts currently is an array of tags associated with the post. When my blog-server reads the blog posts in, it should create a collection of those tags and return those in the `GET` response. With those added, I'll then need to add a filter on posts by tag. It should be pretty cool when it's done but we're still early in progress here.

The other thing I look forward to having is a simple comment section on the blog. I have an area where you can click the comments section, but there's no way to add comments. That's a pretty big project I imagine since I want to make it easy to add comments for anyone, but I want to at least make it a LITTLE bit of a challenge for bots to make comments. We'll see... that's a ways out for sure.
