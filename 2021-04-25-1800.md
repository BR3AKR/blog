It's been a little while since I've worked on my blog, but an idea that I've been kicking around is really 
stripping it down to the bare parts. The idea being that a blog is, and should be, a simple thing. Before,
the blog was composed of two parts, the backend written in Go, and the frontend - a react app. 

<!--BREAK-->

React is fine, I really have no problem with it, except that managing it *and* the blog server can be tedious. 
So I'm dropping the frontend and moving over to using Go templates. This massively reduced the weight of
the overall project. I also dropped the w3 schools css framework. It's also fine, but I like the idea of just
managing the css myself in a single file provided from the same project. It hasn't taken long and I already
have something half decent.

The last part I removed was the need for the blog entries to be on the server. Instead, when the blog starts up
it just calls github and downloads all of the blog entires. This eliminates the need for yet another project
that was just executing a git pull.

The blog isn't very attractive anymore. I'm okay with that. I'm not really doing this to get tons of foot
traffic or impress people. I'm doing it because it's a place for me to store some thoughts, and if others
get something out of it, that's great! I'll continue working on the styling and maybe someday it'll look
good but for now I'm happy with it.
