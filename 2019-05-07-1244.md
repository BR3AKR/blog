I recently had the (dis)pleasure of trying to use log4j2 in Spring Boot. The documentation I came across seemed to often be wrong / outdated so I figured I'd document it here in-case anyone else is looking to solve this problem.

## Add the Configuration Files to Your Project

In my project I have four configuration files under the resources directory of my spring-boot project. I like to separate these so that I can have different log setups in different environments. Here are the config files I used:

`application.yml`
`application-dev.yml`
`log4j2.yml`
`log4j2-dev.yml`

## Modify the Configuration Files

The `application.yml` files tell spring where to go to get the log4j configs. For example my `application.yml` contains like this (in addition to other spring-boot stuff):

``` YML
logging:
 config: classpath:log4j2.yml
  level:
    org.springframework: INFO
```

and my `application-dev.yml` contains this:

``` YML
logging:
  config: classpath:log4j2-dev.yml
  level:
    org.springframework: INFO
```

In our production environment, it's easiest to aggregate our logs if they're treated as json events. So the default `log4j2.yml` looks like this:

``` YML
Configuration:
  name: Default
  thresholdFilter:
    level: debug
  appenders:
    Console:
      name: STDOUT
      JSONLayout:
        compact: true
        eventEol: true
        properties: true
  loggers:
    root:
      AppenderRef:
        ref: STDOUT
```

`log4j2-dev.yml` (you're welcome for the pretty colors)

``` YML
  Configuration:
  name: Default
  thresholdFilter:
    level: trace
  appenders:
    Console:
      name: STDOUT
      PatternLayout:
        pattern: "%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %highlight{%level}{FATAL=bg_red, ERROR=red, WARN=yellow, INFO=green, DEBUG=blue} - %msg%n"
  loggers:
    root:
      AppenderRef:
        ref: STDOUT
```

## Modify Your Dependencies File

In my pom.xml file I had to add an exclusions section to any dependency with an org.springframework.boot group id. I did this because logback is kind is a redundant dependency if you're using log4j2. In addition, logback doesn't play nicely with yml configs:

``` XML
<exclusions>
  <exclusion>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
  </exclusion>
</exclusions>
```

I also added the necessary config to get log4j2 in spring boot:

``` XML
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And to get spring boot to read yaml configs, you also need jackson dependencies:

``` XML
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-yaml</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Run Spring Boot with a Profile

Now if you run spring boot with the dev profile ( -Dspring.profiles.active=dev ), you'll get nice easily human-readable console log, but if you run it with any other profile you'll get the json formatted output.
