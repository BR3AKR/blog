I recently decided I wanted to get my little blog project and my wiki off of AWS and get it  running locally for a pair of reasons. First off, and most practical - I'm spending ~$10/mo on running my amazon ec2 instance. Which was pretty neat, but it's just money I don't need to be spending. Another reason is that I'd like to manage my own server for learning purposes. Going through the headache of getting my little raspberry pi to serve up my blog is a great learning opportunity.

I've spent most of the morning working on it and managed to get my pi server running my blog locally. I'm now able to hit my nginx server that's running on the pi, then the client is calling my backend services written in go. I'd like to put up a more detailed blog post explaining this in the near future but I also wanted to test the changes I've made so far by writing up a quick post!
