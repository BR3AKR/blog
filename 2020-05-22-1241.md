I finished implementing comments on my blog today. I keep finding phrases to talk
it down - "no big deal", "small potatoes", "going to add more". I'm going to avoid
using those words and just say, it feels good to get something out there. It just
feels nice to set a goal and deliver on it.

I wanted adding comments to be as painless as possible while still reducing spam
that I get. There's no login required or anything, just type whatever you want
as your name and your comment and let google know you're not a robot. They'll
let me know when I check in with them on the server side.

The comments are handled with a separate service backed by postres database. It
has a trio of endpoints, one for posting a comment, one for getting comments for
a post, and one for getting the comment counts for a post. Once again, this is
all written in Go.

For the frontend, the posts are another react component and I added google's
reCAPTCHA to verify posters aren't robots. I'll look at adding the more seamless
version in the future, but I think this will suffice for now.

Future plans for comments include allowing markdown in the comment, and code
formatting.
