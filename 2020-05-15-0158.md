Hello, Anxiety, my old friend. Another deployment night has come, and the stress
that comes with it. I've been through a hundred (or more) of these
in my career now and they still terrify me. I can't be alone in this, can I? You
work so hard, you write test cases, you execute load tests and you talk through
worst case scenarios.. and yet when it comes time to press the "go" button,
something deep inside me screams "No!".

I'm sick of it. If I'm being honest, it's enough to make me want to search out
another avenue as a programmer. Most of the time, these things go well. But those
few times they haven't, it's mortifying. You're stuck scrambling. You have a roll-
back plan, but what if it isn't adequate? Everyone starts playing monday-morning
quarterback, finger-pointing. Probing questions in embarrassing meetings. All just
reminding you of what you've always known - you're no good at this, and really
should just find another career.

I'd love to wrap this up in a happy bow and walk away. Maybe I'll be capable of 
that after the deployment. The fact is, I'm miserable, and hateful. My stomach
aches, and I want to throw up. I'm watching my wife and my daughter play a game.
They're dancing and they're giggling but I can't crack a smile. Damn this feeling.
